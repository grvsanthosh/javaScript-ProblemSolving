### Divisor
A divisor is any number that divides another number. The number being divided is called the dividend. The result of the division is called the quotient.

### proper divisor
any divisor of that number that is not the number itself

### Amicable numbers
Two numbers are amicable if the sum of the proper divisors of one number is equal to the other number, and vice versa. For example, 220 and 284 are amicable because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220

### perfect number
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, which are all of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128.

### Factor
a whole number that divides another number evenly, meaning without leaving a remainder

### Proper Factor
any factor of the number except the number itself

### composite number

A number that is divisible by a number other than 1 and the number itself, is called a composite number. This means that composite numbers have more than 2 factors. For example, 4 and 6 are composite numbers

### Palindrome 

A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121 and 12321 are palindromic numbers

### happy number

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1

For example, letâ€™s say your input was 19. The expected output would be true. 19, when broken down into its digits, is 1 and 9. Those numbers squared are 1 and 81. 1 + 81 is 82. 82 broken into its digits is 8 and 2. Those numbers squared are 64 and 4, and 64 + 4 = 68. 68 broken down into its digits is 6 and 8. Those numbers squared is 36 and 64. 36 + 64 = 100. 100 broken down into its digits is 1, 0, and 0. Those numbers squared and summed is 1, which makes it a happy number.
