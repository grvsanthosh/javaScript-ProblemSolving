### Divisor
A divisor is any number that divides another number. The number being divided is called the dividend. The result of the division is called the quotient.

### proper divisor
any divisor of that number that is not the number itself

### Amicable numbers
Two numbers are amicable if the sum of the proper divisors of one number is equal to the other number, and vice versa. For example, 220 and 284 are amicable because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220

### perfect number
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, which are all of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496, and 8128.
